# LaTeXChapterswExtraPages
The files necessary to generate two chapters of the book with extra pages 

For some reason my preamble is causing my generated book to add extra pages between chapters, which also upsets the "book convention" and changes it to some version of "openany" where chapters do not all start on even pages.

I have been giving away free copies of the book to collect feedback and I had multiple people tell me the text seemed to small, or tight. After comparing to some other, professionally made books I own, I determined the major difference was line spacing. 

I have set \singlespacing and \onehalfspacing for certain sections, but when I do it ends up adding those extra pages I can't seems to get rid of. If there is anyway I can maintain that and eliminate the pages, or another command that would allow me to acheive onehalf spacing (which seems to be a bit of a misnomer since it is 1.5 spacing) I would be ever grateful. I thought it might have something to with switching between single spacing (for the disclaimer) and onehalf spacing, but even with the entire book at \onehalfspacing i still get the extra pages.

Thanks,
Matt C
