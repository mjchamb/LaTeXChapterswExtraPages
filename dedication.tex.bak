\chapter*{Dedication}\label{Dedication}

This book is dedicated to my parents. I only realized with age just how lucky I was to have two wonderful people doing their best to raise me. I hope to be the best of both of you.\\ \\

And to my beautiful, intelligent, and considerate fiance Dr. Mary Cole, who has always supported me in everything I do, and draws pretty great wizard cartoons.
